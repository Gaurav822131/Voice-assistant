An interactive voice assistant called BotChat was created to effectively comprehend and carry out spoken orders. 
It was developed with Python and incorporates online automation, text-to-speech conversion, and speech recognition to improve user ease. 
The assistant processes commands, responds dynamically via text and voice, and listens to voice input. 
It can retrieve real-time weather updates, play YouTube videos, open websites, and display the current time and date. 
The bot provides a smooth user experience thanks to its clear and simple GUI, which was created with Tkinter. 
High accuracy is guaranteed by the speech recognition module, and seamless voice output is made possible using Pygame and Google Text-to-Speech (gTTS). 
Threading also guarantees that the bot stays responsive while performing tasks. 
Whether you need to play music, check the weather, or access information hands-free,BotChat acts as a reliable and efficient personal assistant, making everyday tasks more accessible through voice commands.
